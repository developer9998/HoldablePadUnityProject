//What 's with these homies, dissing my girl?
//Why do they gotta front ?
//What did we ever do to these guys
//That made them so violent?
//Woo-hoo
//But you know I'm yours
//Woo-hoo
//And I know you're mine
//Woo-hoo
//(And that's for all time)
//Ooh-wee-hoo, I look just like Buddy Holly
//Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
//I don't care what they say about us anyway
//I don't care about that
//Don't you ever fear, I'm always near
//I know that you need help
//Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit
//You need a guardian
//Woo-hoo
//And you know I'm yours
//Woo-hoo
//And I know you're mine
//Woo-hoo
//(And that's for all time)
//Ooh-wee-hoo, I look just like Buddy Holly
//Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
//I don't care what they say about us anyway
//I don't care about that
//I don't care about that
//Bang, bang, a knock on the door
//Another big bang and you're down on the floor
//Oh no! What do we do?
//Don't look now, but I lost my shoe
//I can't run, and I can't kick
//What's the matter babe, are you feeling sick?
//What's the matter, what's the matter, what's the matter you?
//What's the matter babe, are you feeling blue?
//Ooh-wee-hoo, I look just like Buddy Holly
//Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
//I don't care what they say about us anyway
//I don't care about that
//I don't care about that
//I don't care about that
//I don't care about that
